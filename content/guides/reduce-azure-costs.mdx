Azure costs don’t blow out because teams are sloppy. They blow out because spending is distributed across services, environments, and owners — and the feedback loop is weak. This guide is a practical system for getting control without slowing delivery.

---

**Who this is for:**

- Small dev teams (1–20) running Azure workloads
- Founders / CTOs who need predictability, not surprises
- Anyone inheriting a messy subscription

**What you’ll walk away with:**

- A short list of the biggest cost leaks to hunt first
- A measurement approach that matches how Azure actually bills
- Guardrails: budgets, alerts, and policies that don’t annoy engineers

Next step: use the **[Cloud Cost Estimator](/tools/cloud-cost-estimator)** to forecast your monthly spend and sanity-check your baseline.

Plug your current numbers into the **[Cloud Cost Estimator](/tools/cloud-cost-estimator)** and explore how much waste you could realistically remove in the next 30–90 days.

## Why cloud costs explode

Most Azure “bill shock” comes from a few repeatable patterns:

- **Sprawl:** multiple environments, regions, and resource groups with no ownership map
- **Always-on:** dev/test resources left running 24/7 because turning things off is manual
- **Hidden multipliers:** data egress, log ingestion, backups, and “small per-GB” charges that stack up
- **Wrong defaults:** over-provisioned SKUs chosen early and never revisited

The fix is not “be careful.” The fix is: make cost visible, assign ownership, then enforce guardrails automatically.

## The five biggest cost leaks in Azure

1. **Idle compute:** VMs, AKS node pools, App Service plans that are oversized or always-on
2. **Log & telemetry ingestion:** Log Analytics / App Insights costs scale fast with chatty apps
3. **Data transfer:** egress + cross-region traffic + CDN misconfigurations
4. **Storage & backups:** snapshot sprawl, retained backups, premium tiers used by default
5. **Unowned resources:** orphaned disks, public IPs, old environments, “temporary” resource groups

Small teams should attack these in order because they’re the highest ROI and usually the easiest to fix.

## How to measure your real spend

A practical measurement loop looks like this:

1. **Start with the Azure Cost Analysis view** for the subscription, grouped by Service and Resource.
2. **Tag ownership** (team, environment, app) and track “untagged” as a first-class problem.
3. **Measure weekly deltas** — not just monthly totals — so you catch changes quickly.
4. **Separate baseline from experiments** (e.g., new features, load tests) so changes have context.

Your first win is usually reducing “unknown spend” to near zero.

## Enforcing budgets without killing velocity

Guardrails that work (and don’t annoy engineers) are:

- **Budgets + alerts:** notify early (50/75/90%) instead of only screaming at 100%
- **Policy:** prevent obviously wasteful SKUs, regions, or public exposure
- **Auto-shutdown:** dev/test resources off-hours, with an escape hatch for urgent work
- **Ownership:** every resource group has a responsible human/team

The trick is making the default path the cheap path.

---

## Forecasting and alerts that actually work

Forecasting becomes reliable when you track:

- **Baseline costs:** the predictable “keep the lights on” portion
- **Usage drivers:** requests, active users, GB ingested, node count, storage growth
- **Planned changes:** releases, migrations, new environments

Alerts should fire on *change*, not just “high spend” — e.g. sudden log ingestion spikes or a new service entering the top 5.

---

## Monthly cost control checklist

- Review top 10 services by cost (and the delta vs last month)
- Find and fix untagged / unowned resources
- Check idle compute (VMs, node pools, app plans)
- Audit log ingestion volumes and retention
- Review storage tiers, snapshots, and backups
- Confirm budgets/alerts/policies still match reality

Next: we’ll turn this into a real “tool-backed” guide by adding a simple calculator and linking it from this page.
